So - I had to shuffle a few things around.
I'm going to have to take a liver sample from you at the end of the study for my data.
Unfortunately I don't have anaesthetic. Funding woes.
Will you allow me to do so? Just need a quick signature. Or a simple yes.

Ugh.
What a disappointment.
Both you and the study.
