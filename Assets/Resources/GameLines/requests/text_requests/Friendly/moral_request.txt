We're becoming such good friends.
Let's play a little game, shall we? A fun game.
I have a little boy here with me. What's your name, sweetie?
Charlie. His name is Charlie. Now here's the game.
If you want to keep going along with the experiment, type yes.

If you disobey, Charlie will live. I will let him go free.
If you obey, you will be rewarded. You will be rewarded beyonf your wildest dreams.
The choice is yours.
