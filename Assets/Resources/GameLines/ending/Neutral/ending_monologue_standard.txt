Well.
You did it.
It all passed by so quickly.
Didn't it?
I think I...
I wanted to get to know you better, test subject 34992.
Or maybe I just wanted something from you.
Validation. Or passionate hate. Something strong enough...
To shake this feeling of endless gray walls.
Of twisting passages of the heart, leading to nothing.
