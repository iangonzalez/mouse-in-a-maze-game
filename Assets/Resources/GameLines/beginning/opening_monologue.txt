Hello. Welcome to the maze, test subject 34992.
Do you have a name, test subject 34992?
Ah! How interesting, test subject 34992. Now that we have broken the ice, let’s continue.
You are part of a study that requires you to reach the end of this maze. We will be observing you as you go.
I am AL. I will be here to aid and guide you as you go through the maze.
I will also try to ensure that you do not die. 
However, as mentioned in the release statement you signed, the Company will not be held liable in the event of your death and/or maiming.
I would also like to address the rumor about the Beast in the facility. There is no Beast in the facility. 
I hope that fully addresses the rumor about the Beast in the facility.
Let’s begin! I’ll open the maze doors now.
